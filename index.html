				<section id="QUE1">
					<h3 class="section-title">What are these?</h3>
					<p>Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.<br> In JavaScript, regular expressions are also objects. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Why should I use these?</h3>
					<h6>Pattern matching</h6>
					<p class="fragment">Regular expressions are great at helping you determine if a string matches a particular format, such as a phone number, email address, or credit card number.</p>
					<h6>Exchange</h6>
					<p class="fragment">Using regular expressions, it's easy to find and replace patterns in a string.</p>
					<h6>Extraction</h6>
					<p class="fragment">Using regular expressions, it is easy to extract pieces of information from a template.</p>
					<h6>Clear and beautiful code</h6>
					<p class="fragment">If you use regular expressions, you can perform complex operations with minimal code.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="QUE2">
					<h3>How do I create a regular expression?</h3>
					<p class="fragment">You have two ways to create regular expressions: using a regular expression literal or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object.</p>
					<h6 class="fragment">Literal</h6>
					<p class="fragment">A regular expression literal consists of a pattern enclosed between slashes.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						let regular = /ab+c/;
  						</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains constant, using this can improve performance.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h6>RegExp</h6>
					<p class="fragment">You can the constructor function of the RegExp object.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						let regular = new RegExp('ab+c');
  						</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">Using the constructor function provides runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="QUE3">
					<h3>What are the rules for writing regular expressions?</h3>
					<p class="fragment">A regular expression pattern is composed of simple characters, such as <span class = "span">/cat/</span>, or a combination of simple and special characters, such as <span class = "span">/ca*t/</span> or <span class = "span">/Number (\d+)\.\d*/ *</span>.</p>
					<p class="fragment">*This example includes parentheses, which are used as a memory device.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="QUE4">
					<h3>I just need to find a combination of letters or a word!</h3>
					<p class="fragment">You need use simple pattern.Simple patterns are constructed of characters for which you want to find a direct match.<br>
					For example, we have simple pattern <span class = "span">/cat/</span> and this pattern matches character combinations in strings only when the exact sequence "cat" occurs.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg = /cat/;
						let input1 = "My cat Emperor can turn off my computer."
						/// There is match here because all characters together and in that order; 
						let input2 = "He is very fat but he likes to eat taco."
						/// It's not a match;
						let input3 = "Rebecca told me, that animals can't turn off the equipment, but he turned off her laptop! It's not a match."
						/// It's not a match;
  						</code></pre>
				</section>

				<section id="QUE5">
					<h3>What if I need to search something more than a direct match?</h3>
					<p class="fragment">When the search for a match requires something more than a direct match, such as finding one or more b's, or finding white space, you can include special characters in the pattern.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg = /ca*t/; 
						/// 'a' means "0 or more occurrences of the preceding item", and this item is 'c';
						let input = 'catdogcatdogcaaaaaat';
						let output = 'caaaaaat'; 
						/// this pattern will match this substring;
  						</code></pre>

				<section id='assertion'>
                    <h4>Assertions</h4>
					<p class="fragment">Assertions include boundaries, which indicate the beginnings and endings of lines and words, and other patterns indicating in some way that a match is possible</p>
					<p class="fragment"><span class = "span">'^'</span> - Matches the beginning of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches immediately after a line break character.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code class="code-3">
						///For example
						let reg = /^C/;
						let input1 = 'iCe';///matching is not here;
						let input2 = 'CoCos'; /// matching is here;
						let output = 'C';
						/// it is the first symbol on input2;
  						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class = "span">'$'</span> - Matches the end of input. If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches immediately before a line break character.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg = /T$/;
						let input1 = 'cacTus';///matching is not here;
						let input2 = 'caT'; /// matching is here;
						let output = 'T';
						/// it is the last symbol on input2;
  						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class = "span">'\b'</span> - Matches a word boundary. This is the position where a word character is not followed or preceded by another word-character, such as between a letter and a space. Note that a matched word boundary is not included in the match. In other words, the length of a matched word boundary is zero.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /\bm/;
						///matches the "m" in input "moon";
						let reg2 = /oo\b/;
						///does not match the "oo" in "moon", because "oo" is followed by "n" which is a word character.
						let reg3 = /\w\b\w/; 
						///will never match anything, because a word character can never be followed by both a non-word and a word character.
						let input1 = 'moon';;
  						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class = "span">'\B'</span> - Matches a non-word boundary. This is a position where the previous and next character are of the same type: Either both must be words, or both must be non-words.</p>
					<p class="fragment"><span class = "span">'x(?=y)'</span> - Lookahead assertion: Matches "x" only if "x" is followed by "y".</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /Cat(?=Emperor)/;
						let input1 = 'Cat';///it is not matching;
						let input2 = 'Emperor'; ///it is not matching too;
						let input3 = 'CatEmperor';///matching is here;
  						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'x(?!y)'</span> - Negative lookahead assertion: Matches "x" only if "x" is not followed by "y".</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code class="code-7">
						///For example
						let reg1 = /Cat(?!Emperor)/;
						let input1 = 'CatEmperor';///it is not matching;
						let input2 = 'Ð¡at Emperor';///matching is here;

				<section id='character'>
					<h4>Character classes</h4>
					<p class="fragment">Character classes distinguish kinds of characters such as, for example, distinguishing between letters and digits.</p>
					<p><span class="span">'.'</span> - Matches any single character except line. </p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /.y/; 
						let input = 'yes';
						let output= 'y';/// not 'yes';
						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Inside a character class, the dot loses its special meaning and matches a literal dot. Note that the m multiline flag doesn't change the dot behavior. So to match a pattern across multiple lines, the character class [^] can be used â it will match any character including newlines.</p>
					<p class="fragment"><span class="span">'\d'</span> - Matches any digit (Arabic numeral). Equivalent to <span class="span">[0-9]</span>.</p>
						<pre class="fragment"><code>
							///For example
							let reg1 = /\d/; 
							let input = 'My mother-in-law has 9 cats';
							let output= '9';
							</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'\D'</span> - Matches any character that is not a digit (Arabic numeral). Equivalent to <span class="span">[^0-9]</span>.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /\D/; 
						let input = '12345Q12345';
						let output= 'Q';
						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'\w'</span> - Matches any alphanumeric character from the basic Latin alphabet, including the underscore. Equivalent to <span class="span"></span>[A-Za-z0-9_]. </p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /\w/; 
						let input = '@#$_Ð¸ÑÐ¤';
						let output= '_';
						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'\W'</span> - Matches any character that is not a word character from the basic Latin alphabet. Equivalent to <span class="span">[^A-Za-z0-9_]</span>.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /\W/; 
						let input = 'MAU!';
						let output= '!';
						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'\s'</span> - Matches a single white space character, including space, tab, form feed, line feed, and other Unicode spaces. Equivalent to <span class="span">[ \f\n\r\t\v\u00a0\u1680\u2000-\u200a\u2028\u2029\u202f\u205f\u3000\ufeff]</span>. For example, <span class="span">/\s\w*/</span> matches <span class="span">" bar"</span> in <span class="span">"foo bar"</span>.</p>
					<p><span>'\S'</span> - Matches a single character other than white space. Equivalent to <span class="span">[^ \f\n\r\t\v\u00a0\u1680\u2000-\u200a\u2028\u2029\u202f\u205f\u3000\ufeff]</span>. For example, <span class="span">/\S\w*/</span> matches "foo" in "foo bar".</p>

				<section id='groups'>
					<h4>Groups and ranges</h4>
					<p class="fragment">Groups and ranges indicate groups and ranges of expression characters.</p>
					<p class="fragment"><span class="span">'x|y'</span> - Matches either "x" or "y".</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /chicken|fish/; 
						let input1 = 'My cat eats chicken';
						let output1= 'chicken';
						let input2 = 'My cat eats fish';
						let output2= 'fish';
						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'[xyz], [a-c]'</span> - A character class. Matches any one of the enclosed characters. You can specify a range of characters by using a hyphen, but if the hyphen appears as the first or last character enclosed in the square brackets it is taken as a literal hyphen to be included in the character class as a normal character.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /[a-c]/; 
						let input1 = 'cotton';
						let output1= 'c';
						let reg2 = /[ab-]/; 
						let input2 = 'pop-corn';
						let output1= '-';
						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'[^xyz], [^a-c]'</span> - A negated or complemented character class. That is, it matches anything that is not enclosed in the brackets. You can specify a range of characters by using a hyphen, but if the hyphen appears as the first or last character enclosed in the square brackets it is taken as a literal hyphen to be included in the character class as a normal character.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 = /[^a-c]/; 
						let input1 = 'abcd';
						let output1= 'd';
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'(x)'</span> - Capturing group: Matches x and remembers the match. For example, <span class="span">/(foo)/</span> matches and remembers "foo" in "foo bar".</p>
					<p><span class="span">'\n'</span> - Where "n" is a positive integer. A back reference to the last substring matching the n parenthetical in the regular expression (counting left parentheses).</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 =  /cat(,)\sdog\1/; 
						let input1 = 'cat, dog, hamster';

				</section>

				<section id='quantifiers'>
					<h4>Quantifiers</h4>
					<p class="fragment">Quantifiers indicate numbers of characters or expressions to match.</p>
					<p class="fragment"><span class="span">'x*'</span> - Matches the preceding item "x" 0 or more times.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 =  /hu*/; 
						let input1 = 'I am huuuuungry!';
						let output1= 'huuuuuu;
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'x+'</span> - Matches the preceding item "x" 1 or more times. Equivalent to <span class="span">{1,}</span>.</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 =  /u+/; 
						let input1 = 'I am hungry!';///it is not matching;
						let output1= 'u;
						let input2 = 'I am huuungry!';///matching is here
						let output2= 'uuu;
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'x?'</span> - Matches the preceding item "x" 0 or 1 times. For example,  <span class="span">/e?le?/</span> matches the "el" in "angel" and the "le" in "angle." If used immediately after any of the quantifiers <span class="span">*, +, ?, or {},</span> makes the quantifier non-greedy (matching the minimum number of times), as opposed to the default, which is greedy (matching the maximum number of times).</p>
					<p><span class="span">'x{n}'</span> - Where "n" is a positive integer, matches exactly "n" occurrences of the preceding item "x". </p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 =  /u{2}/; 
						let input1 = 'I am hungry!';///it is not matching
						let input2 = 'I am huuungry!';///matching is here
						let output1= 'uu;
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'x{n,}'</span> - Where "n" is a positive integer, matches at least "n" occurrences of the preceding item "x".</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 =  /u{2,}/; 
						let input1 = 'I am hungry!';///it is not matching
						let input2 = 'I am huuungry!';///matching is here
						let output1= 'uuu';
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><span class="span">'x{n,m}'</span> - Where "n" is 0 or a positive integer, "m" is a positive integer, and m > n, matches at least "n" and at most "m" occurrences of the preceding item "x".</p>
					<pre class="fragment"><code>
						///For example
						let reg1 =  /a{1,3}/; 
						let input1 = 'Mu!';///it is not matching
						let input2 = 'Mau!';///matching is here
						let output2= 'a';
						let input3 = 'Maaaaaaaaaaau!';///matching is here
						let output3= 'aaa';
					</code></pre>
					<p class="fragment">By default quantifiers like <span class="span">*</span> and <span class="span">+</span> are "greedy", meaning that they try to match as much of the string as possible. The <span class="span">?</span> character after the quantifier makes the quantifier "non-greedy": meaning that it will stop as soon as it finds a match. </p>

					<h4>Unicode property escapes</h4>
					<p class="fragment">Unicode property escapes Regular Expressions allows for matching characters based on their Unicode properties. A character is described by several properties which are either binary ("boolean-like") or non-binary. For instance, unicode property escapes can be used to match emojis, punctuations, letters (even letters from specific languages or scripts), etc.</p>

				<section id="QUE6">
					<h3>How can I match characters to search?</h3>
					<p class="fragment">If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually searching for a <span class="span">"*"</span>, for instance), you must escape it by putting a backslash in front of it. For instance, to search for <span class="span">"a"</span> followed by <span class="span">"*"</span> followed by <span class="span">"b"</span>, you'd use <span class="span">/a\*b/</span> â the backslash <span class="span">"escapes"</span> the <span class="span">"*"</span>, making it literal instead of special.<br>
						Similarly, if you're writing a regular expression literal and need to match a slash <span class="span"></span>("/"), you need to escape that (otherwise, it terminates the pattern). For instance, to search for the string <span class="span">"/example/"</span> followed by one or more alphabetic characters, you'd use <span class="span">/\/example\/[a-z]+/</span>iâthe backslashes before each slash make them literal.<br>
						To match a literal backslash, you need to escape the backslash. For instance, to match the string <span class="span">"C:\"</span> where <span class="span">"C"</span> can be any letter, you'd use <span class="span">/[A-Z]:\\/ </span>â the first backslash escapes the one after it, so the expression searches for a single literal backslash.<br>
						If using the RegExp constructor with a string literal, remember that the backslash is an escape in string literals, so to use it in the regular expression, you need to escape it at the string literal level. <span class="span">/a\*b/</span> and <span class="span">new RegExp("a\\*b")</span> create the same expression, which searches for <span class="span">"a"</span> followed by a literal <span class="span">"*"</span> followed by <span class="span">"b"</span>.

If you use <span class="span">exec()</span> or <span class="span">match()</span> and if the match succeeds, these methods return an array and update properties of the associated regular expression object and also of the predefined regular expression object, RegExp. If the match fails, the <span class="span"></span> method returns null (which coerces to false).</p>
